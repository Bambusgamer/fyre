# Crash course JS, node.js and discord.js v14

## Installing js on your computer

To run js on your computer you have to install node.js. This is just a js engine (like a browser) that runs your js code. Js is compiled *just in time*, meaning it is compiled the moment you import the code with *import('module.js')* or *require('module.js')*.

### Installing node.js

[Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

I would recommend you install the v16 LTS (*long time support*) variant:
[Direct download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.17.1/node-v16.17.1-x64.msi)

Just click trough the installer but enable the **Tools for native modules**. After that just let the installer run and let it do its thing.

## Installing a code editor

To write your js code you should download a code editor like the open source **Vsc** (*Visual Studio Code*)

[Vsc Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Click on download and then just install but don't forget to enable both **open with code** options. After that let the installer do its thing.
